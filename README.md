# Acea Water Analytics Kaggle Contest

**Current working streams:**
1.  Cross correlation(Mansit)
1.  Granger causality(Vijay)
1.  Fourier fitting(Mansit, Vijay)
1.  Exploring new techniques(Aditya)

**Current techniques:**
1.  VAR
1.  FB Prophet 
1.  LSTM**

**Points for further research**
1. Climate in Italy (Correlation between temperature and rainfall)- done
1. Reasearch the measurements of water level 

**Things to do**
1.  Violin plots for getting a clear idea of depth of ground water
1.  Coding map on python
1.  Using PCA- https://builtin.com/data-science/step-step-explanation-principal-component-analysis
1.  Scatter plot(Depth vs rainfall) of mean on months(points).   Expected conclusions- Here we find that the rainfall is high during nov, dec, jan, feb and the depth to groundwater level is high in the preceeding 3 months March, April and May. May be this is due to the lag effect.
