# Acea Water Analytics Kaggle Contest

**Current working streams:**
1.  Keggle kernel working- MS
1.  Linear Regression,XG Boost -VJ
1.  Prophet, Light GBM- KS
1.  Random Forest, LSTM- DJ
1.  Fixing missing value- VT,MS
1.  Feature engg.- VT
1.  Transformation
1.  Cross validation

**Points for further research**
1. Climate in Italy (Correlation between temperature and rainfall)- done
1. Reasearch the measurements of water level 
1. Using cumsum for feature engineering

**Things to do**
1.  Coding map on python
1.  Using PCA- https://builtin.com/data-science/step-step-explanation-principal-component-analysis
1.  dataframe formation from lags
1.  adf test and grenger causality
1.  Scatter plot(Depth vs rainfall) of mean on months(points).   Expected conclusions- Here we find that the rainfall is high during nov, dec, jan, feb and the depth to groundwater level is high in the preceeding 3 months March, April and May. May be this is due to the lag effect.
