**Highlights**

1. which features influence EACH different waterbodies' behavior
2. What all data is required to build a dataset 
3. Description of which features must be discarded
4. how data must be dropped/augmented
5. which data interval is meaningful for our problem
6. Resolve/discover hyperparameters to pass to the mathematical mode.
7. performed analysis on the data
8.  forecasting waterbodiesâ€™ water availability in terms of level or water flow in a given **time interval of the year**(for instance, for a model working on a monthly interval a forecast over the month is expected)
9. we expect a model for each different kind/category of waterbody (Aquifer, Water Spring, River and Lake) and we expect the applicability of these models to each single waterbody (Auser, Amiata, Petrignano, Doganella, Luco, Madonna di Canneto, Lupa, Arno, Bilancino)
10. A procedure creating the model at 4. This procedure should guarantee the replicability of the models to waterbodies which are not object of this competition.
