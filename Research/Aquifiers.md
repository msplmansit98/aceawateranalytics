There are two types of **aquifer**- confined and unconfined.

A **confined aquifer** is an aquifer below the land surface that is saturated with water. Layers of impermeable material are both above and below the aquifer, causing it to be under pressure so that when the aquifer is penetrated by a well, the water will rise above the top of the aquifer.

A **water-table--or unconfined--aquifer** is an aquifer whose upper water surface (water table) is at atmospheric pressure, and thus is able to rise and fall. Water-table aquifers are usually closer to the Earth's surface than confined aquifers are, and as such are impacted by drought conditions sooner than confined aquifers.

## Aquifer Doganella

The wells field Doganella is fed by **two** underground aquifers not fed by rivers or lakes but fed by **meteoric infiltration**.
(Meteoric Infiltration- infiltered by rainwater) The **upper aquifer is a water table**(unconfined aquifer) with a thickness of about 30m. The lower aquifer is a **semi-confined artesian(confined) aquifer** with a thickness of 50m and is located inside lavas and tufa(a porous rock formed as a deposit from springs or streams specifically ) products. These aquifers are accessed through wells called Well 1, ..., Well 9. Approximately **80%** of the drainage volumes come from the artesian aquifer. The aquifer levels are influenced by the following parameters: **rainfall, humidity, subsoil, temperatures and drainage volumes.**

## Aquifer Petrignano

The wells field of the **alluvial plain**(alluvial aquifer) between Ospedalicchio di Bastia Umbra and Petrignano is fed by **three underground aquifers** separated by low permeability septa. The aquifer can be considered a **water table groundwater** and is also fed by the **Chiascio river**. The groundwater levels are influenced by the following parameters: **rainfall, depth to groundwater, temperatures and drainage volumes, level of the Chiascio river.**



**Alluvial aquifers** are generally shallower than sedimentary and fractured rock aquifers and water levels often fluctuate due to varying recharge and pumping rates. Due to their shallow and unconfined nature, alluvial aquifers are susceptible to contamination and pollution. 



## Aquifer Auser

This waterbody consists of two subsystems, called NORTH and SOUTH, where the former partly influences the behavior of the latter. Indeed, the north subsystem is a water table (or unconfined) aquifer while the south subsystem is an artesian (or confined) groundwater.

The levels of the NORTH sector are represented by the values of the SAL, PAG, CoS and DIEC wells, while the levels of the SOUTH sector by the LT2 well.

## Aquifer Luco

The Luco wells field is fed by an **underground aquifer**. This aquifer **not fed by rivers or lakes** but by **meteoric infiltration** at the **extremes** of the impermeable sedimentary layers. Such aquifer is accessed through wells called Well 1, Well 3 and Well 4 and is influenced by the following parameters: **rainfall, depth to groundwater, temperature and drainage volumes.**

*So focus on rainfall that are present in the boundaries.*





*Further do some research on google for each of the waterbody for better outlook*
