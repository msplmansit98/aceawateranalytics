## Climate in Italy

Italy has a predominantly **Mediterranean climate** with mild, sometimes rainy winters and sunny, hot, and usually dry summers. However, with such a large area and so many different geographical features—from high mountains to over 4,000 miles of coastline, you’ll find plenty of regional differences and even micro-climates.
